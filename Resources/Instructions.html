Welcome to CALCView.  CALCView allows you to easily create, copy and debug CALC, CALCA, LOGIC, and MATH blocks.  It should only 
take a few minutes to get familiar with CALCView.<br><br>

<H2><a name="ref1">1.0 A Quick Introduction</a></H2>

<H3><a name ="ref1a">1.1 Simulating a block</a></H3>

Using CALCView is very simple. You enter the steps on the left side of the window.  When you use registers in a step, it appears in the
upper right side of the window.<br><br>

Type in the following program:<br><br>
<code>
STEP01 = IN BI01<br>
STEP02 = BIT 12<br>
STEP03 = INC RO01<br>
STEP04 = IN RO01<br>
STEP05 = SIN<br>
STEP06 = BIP 10<br>
STEP07 = INC RO02<br>
STEP08 = SBD RO02<br>
STEP09 = EXIT<br>
STEP10 = DEC RO02<br>
STEP11 = CBD RO02<br>
STEP12 = END
</code><br><br>

To edit a line, you have to double-click it. If you make a mistake, a red dot will appear beside the statement indicating
an error.<br><br>

Notice when you enter a line that references a register, that register is added to the list of registers.  This way only the information
that is useful to you is displayed.<br><br>

Now click on the "Play" button.  This executes the block.  The green dots beside the statements show which lines were 
executed. Some of the lines were not executed because of the branch statement in STEP02. Any registers that have been modified
also have green dots beside them.<br><br>

You can change how the sample program branches by changing the value of BI01 to 0 or 1.<br><br>

Also note the behaviour of the BAD checkbox. The program sets and clears the BAD status of RO01. You may also toggle it
manually.<br><br>

Try the "Step" button.  This executes the lines one at a time so you can watch how the stack is affected by the
instructions.<br><br>

The "Loop" button executes the block at regular intervals which is settable in the settings window. The button turns green to
indicate that looping is turned on. Press "Stop" to stop looping. You can change registers while the program is looping to test 
various conditions.<br><br>

<H3><a name ="ref1b">1.2 Using the Online Functionality</a></H3>

CALCView also allows you to connect to a process.  Simply select a CP and type in the Compond and Block separated by ":".  If you want
to load in the steps for an existing block, click "Get". If you want to write the steps back to a CP, click "Put".<br><br>

You can also read and write individual registers. When you click the "online" checkbox, any registers the have the "GET" checkbox checked on
will be read when the block first starts executing. Similarly, any registers with "PUT" checked on will be written when the block finished 
execution (NOTE: you may have to put the block in manual to write some parameters).<br><br>


<H2><a name="ref2">2.0 FAQ</a></H2>
<H3><a name ="ref2a">2.1 What is the "Foxboro approved" way to install java on a Solaris 2.5 system?</a></H3>

Solaris 2.5 requires Java 1.2.2 which is avalable from Sun (http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html).Ê 
It also requires the installation of 4 Solaris patches which are also available from Sun:<br><br>

NOTE: Java 1.2 is the last version of Java that will run on Solaris 2.5 so don't bother trying the newer versions.<br><br>

<code>
103461-33  http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/findPatch.pl?patchId=103461&rev=33<br>
103566-56  http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/findPatch.pl?patchId=103566&rev=56<br>
103627-13  http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/findPatch.pl?patchId=103627&rev=13<br>
103640-37  http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/findPatch.pl?patchId=103640&rev=37<br><br>
</code>

To install the patches follow these directions:<br><br>

1. Backup sad. Type the following:<br>
<code>
cd /kernel/drv<br>
cp sad sad.org<br><br>
</code>

2. Resart in single user mode.<br><br>

3. Decompress the patches and run "installpatch -d ." in each of the patch directories.<br><br>

4. Replace sad. Type the following:<br>
<code>
cd /kernel/drv<br>
mv sad.org sad<br>
</code>

<H3><a name ="ref2b">2.2 Any tricks in doing a Windows install of java?</a></H3>

No tricks. Just follow the instructions on Sun's web site. You can use the latest version - JRE 1.4.1 as of this writing.

<H3><a name ="ref2c">2.3 Are there any Solaris limitations in CALCView?</a></H3>

The only thing wrong with CALCView on a Solaris system is a few of the dialogs get a blue border. We believe this is due to a bug in 
Java 1.2.2 and are looking for a way around it.Ê However, the program is still completely functional.

<H3><a name ="ref2d">2.4 Are there any Windows limitations in CALCView?</a></H3>

The icc driver task fail during an upload or a download for some unknown reason (spinit problem).Ê We are looking into a fix or a 
workaround.Ê You can manually dump blocks with the icc driver task an open them in CALCView for debugging.
